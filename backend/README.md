# Backend Service Setup
To run the backend service, follow the steps below:

Execute the command in your terminal at "/backend" directory.

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start two services: the Database (Postgres) and the REST API (FastAPI).

## API Documentation
Once the services are running, you can access the API documentation by navigating to the "/docs" path.
